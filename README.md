# Daily Case Tracker

A simple, minimalistic web-based application for tracking daily cases. This app allows you to enter a case/transaction ID, automatically records the timestamp, displays your progress against a daily goal, and lets you export the data to a CSV file for Excel. All data is stored locally in the browser's localStorage, ensuring each user's data remains private.

## Features

- **Add Case:** Input a case/transaction ID and record it with a timestamp.
- **Progress Bar:** Visualize today's progress against a configurable daily goal (default is 20 cases).
- **Local Data Storage:** Data is stored in the browser's localStorage, so it persists across sessions without sending information to any server.
- **Export Data:** Easily export your case data to a CSV file that can be opened in Excel.
- **Clear Data:** Option to clear all stored data with a confirmation prompt.
